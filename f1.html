                Free Fire, the world-famous survival shooter game available on mobile. Each 10-minute
                game places you on a remote island where you are pit against 49 other players,
                all seeking survival. Players freely choose their starting point with their parachute,
                and aim to stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. Drive vehicles to explore the
                vast map, hide in the wild, or become invisible by proning under grass or rifts. Ambush,
                snipe, survive, there is only one goal: to survive and answer the call of duty.

                Facebook is the official Android app for the iconic original social network par excellence.
                Once again, this app is here to simplify your Facebook experience by providing
                all your favorite features from one spot.
                Essentially, this Facebook app has the same features as its original browser version.
                The only main difference you'll notice is that you can't play Facebook games on it.

                That said, gaming aside, you'll get all the same updates from friends and family,
                browse your timeline, upload and save photos, change your status, and comment —the whole lot
                from anywhere.

                One of the best features of this official Facebook app is the option to share all kinds of content.
                You can upload photos and videos straight from your gallery directly onto your account.
